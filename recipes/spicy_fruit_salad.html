    <h1>Sweet and Spicy Summer Fruit Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Some of summer’s most notable offerings are stone fruit, tomatoes and basil. While they thrive 
        in the sun, they gain even more flavor when dressed in a savory-spicy vinaigrette. In this 
        spoonable salad, the components resemble a fragmented mosaic: Sweet stone fruit of any kind, 
        from cherries to peaches to pluots, is cut small and tossed with juicy cherry tomatoes and aromatic 
        basil in a chile crisp vinaigrette. The vinaigrette is simple to make, only requiring a bit of sugar 
        to build on the fruit's natural quality, along with red wine vinegar to add fruity depth.

    <ul>
        <li>Mixing Bowls</li>
        <li>Chef Knife</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons mild-tasting olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons store-bought or homemade chile crisp</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds stone fruit, such as plums, pluots, cherries, <br>
            nectarines or peaches, or a combination</li>
        <li>10 ounces cherry tomatos</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup basil leaves, lightly packed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, chile crisp, vinegar and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pit the stone fruit and cut the larger fruit into ½-inch wedges, then cut each wedge 
            into ½-inch pieces. Halve the cherries, if using. Place the fruit in the vinaigrette 
            bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, add to the bowl, season with salt and toss very well. 
            Taste and adjust vinaigrette seasonings as desired. (This salad can be made up to a 
            day ahead and stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare for baking:</strong> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425℉/218℃.<br><br>
            
            Meanwhile, remove the chicken from the fridge. Remove the chicken from the bag, and set <br>
            it over the bowl (or baking sheet) to drip off any excess buttermilk. Use your hands to <br>
            "squeegee" and remove as much buttermilk as possible.<br><br>
            
            Transfer chicken to a large (10-inch+) cast-iron skillet breast-side up. Truss and tie <br>
            the legs together with kitchen twine, and allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour <br>
            before baking. If desired, grind some freshly ground black pepper over the top of the <br>
            chicken.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Note:</strong> For even crispier skin, use a paper towel to pat the skin dry.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pan all the way in the back of the oven such that the legs are pointing <br>
            toward the rear left corner and the breast is pointing towards the center of the oven.<br>

            Once the chicken begins to sizzle and brown, after about 20 minutes, reduce the heat <br>
            to 400℉/204℃. Bake for an additional 10 minutes.<br><br>

            Rotate the pan so that the legs are pointing towards the rear right corner, and <br>
            continue baking until the chicken is fully browned and cooked through, about 30 <br>
            more minutes.<br><br>

            <strong>Note:</strong> When roasting a whole chicken, the breast tends to overcook before the legs <br>
            finish cooking through. The back of the oven tends to be the hottest, so pointing <br>
            the legs towards the hotter areas and keeping the breast in the center allows the <br>
            chicken to cook through more evenly.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest:</strong> Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 – 15 minutes <br>
            before carving into pieces. Serve warm with the pan juices, and enjoy.<br>
        </li>
