    <h1>Sweet and Spicy Summer Fruit Salad</h1>
    <img src="../img/cr-summer-fruit-salad-lgvk-threeByTwoMediumAt2X.webp" width = 400 alt="a picture of a delicious and colorful fruit salad"><br>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Some of summer’s most notable offerings are stone fruit, tomatoes and basil. While they thrive 
        in the sun, they gain even more flavor when dressed in a savory-spicy vinaigrette. In this 
        spoonable salad, the components resemble a fragmented mosaic: Sweet stone fruit of any kind, 
        from cherries to peaches to pluots, is cut small and tossed with juicy cherry tomatoes and aromatic 
        basil in a chile crisp vinaigrette. The vinaigrette is simple to make, only requiring a bit of sugar 
        to build on the fruit's natural quality, along with red wine vinegar to add fruity depth.

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Gallon-Size Ziploc Bags</li>
        <li>1 10-inch Cast Iron Skillet</li>
        <li>1 Butcher's Twine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3 1/2 to 4 pounds whole chicken</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon Diamond-Crystal Kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>Freshy ground black pepper, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep and season:</strong> A day before cooking your chicken, cut off the wing tip by using sharp <br>
            scissors or a knife to cut through the first wing joint. Reserve for stock, if desired.<br><br>

            Generously season the chicken with about 1 teaspoon Diamond-Crystal kosher salt (or ½ <br>
            teaspoon Morton Kosher Salt) and allow to rest for 30 minutes.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> In a large measuring cup, combine 2 tablespoons Diamond-Crystal <br>
            Kosher Salt (or 1 tablespoon Morton Kosher Salt) with 2 cups buttermilk.<br><br>

            Carefully place the chicken in a double-bagged gallon-size Ziploc bag, then pour in <br>
            the buttermilk. Seal the bag as best you can, squeezing out any air.<br><br>
            
            Rotate the chicken in the bag to ensure the buttermilk coats all crevices, then place <br>
            the bag into a large bowl or a rimmed baking sheet into the fridge. Marinate for 12 – 24 <br>
            hours before cooking.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Note:</strong> If the chicken does not fit into the Ziploc bag, you can place it into a <br>
            double-bagged plastic produce bag and seal it with some twine.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare for baking:</strong> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425℉/218℃.<br><br>
            
            Meanwhile, remove the chicken from the fridge. Remove the chicken from the bag, and set <br>
            it over the bowl (or baking sheet) to drip off any excess buttermilk. Use your hands to <br>
            "squeegee" and remove as much buttermilk as possible.<br><br>
            
            Transfer chicken to a large (10-inch+) cast-iron skillet breast-side up. Truss and tie <br>
            the legs together with kitchen twine, and allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour <br>
            before baking. If desired, grind some freshly ground black pepper over the top of the <br>
            chicken.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Note:</strong> For even crispier skin, use a paper towel to pat the skin dry.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pan all the way in the back of the oven such that the legs are pointing <br>
            toward the rear left corner and the breast is pointing towards the center of the oven.<br>

            Once the chicken begins to sizzle and brown, after about 20 minutes, reduce the heat <br>
            to 400℉/204℃. Bake for an additional 10 minutes.<br><br>

            Rotate the pan so that the legs are pointing towards the rear right corner, and <br>
            continue baking until the chicken is fully browned and cooked through, about 30 <br>
            more minutes.<br><br>

            <strong>Note:</strong> When roasting a whole chicken, the breast tends to overcook before the legs <br>
            finish cooking through. The back of the oven tends to be the hottest, so pointing <br>
            the legs towards the hotter areas and keeping the breast in the center allows the <br>
            chicken to cook through more evenly.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest:</strong> Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 – 15 minutes <br>
            before carving into pieces. Serve warm with the pan juices, and enjoy.<br>
        </li>
