    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Some of summer’s most notable offerings are stone fruit, tomatoes and basil. While they thrive 
        in the sun, they gain even more flavor when dressed in a savory-spicy vinaigrette. In this 
        spoonable salad, the components resemble a fragmented mosaic: Sweet stone fruit of any kind, 
        from cherries to peaches to pluots, is cut small and tossed with juicy cherry tomatoes and aromatic 
        basil in a chile crisp vinaigrette. The vinaigrette is simple to make, only requiring a bit of sugar 
        to build on the fruit's natural quality, along with red wine vinegar to add fruity depth.

    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons mild-tasting olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons store-bought or homemade chile crisp</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds stone fruit, such as plums, pluots, cherries, <br>
            nectarines or peaches, or a combination</li>
        <li>10 ounces cherry tomatos</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup basil leaves, lightly packed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, chile crisp, vinegar and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pit the stone fruit and cut the larger fruit into ½-inch wedges, then cut each wedge 
            into ½-inch pieces. Halve the cherries, if using. Place the fruit in the vinaigrette 
            bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, add to the bowl, season with salt and toss very well. 
            Taste and adjust vinaigrette seasonings as desired. (This salad can be made up to a 
            day ahead and stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)
        </li>
        <li>
            When ready to serve, cut or tear the basil into small pieces, add to the bowl and 
            toss everything well to combine.
        </li>
    </ol>
