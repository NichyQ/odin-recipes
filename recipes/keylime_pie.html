    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Classic key lime pie is a beloved warm-weather treat that’s beyond easy to make from scratch. <br>
        Plus, it bakes up in just 10 minutes! Because of a reaction between the acidic lime juice, <br>
        sweetened condensed milk, and egg yolks, the custard-like filling sets up in a flash and only  <br>
        needs a short baking time.
        <br>
        <br>
        The velvety key lime filling sits atop a crisp homemade graham cracker crust, which comes together <br>
        so quickly as well. In fact, this easy key lime pie recipe only takes 15 minutes of hands-on prep! <br>
        Truly, the hardest part is waiting for the pie to chill completely in the refrigerator before digging in. <br>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9-inch pie plate</li>
        <li>Mixing bowls</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Crust</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (180g)</li>
        <li>6-8 tablespoons unsalted butter (87g to 113g), melted, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (14-ounce, 396g) cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup key lime juice (180ml)</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lime or key lime zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Topping</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream (240ml)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li><em>Optional</em>: Lime zest and thinly sliced key limes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the Crust</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, stir together graham cracker crumbs, 6 tablespoons of melted butter, <br>
            and sugar until well moistened. Pinch the crumbs between your thumb, pointer and <br>
            middle fingers. If they feel moist and stick together when released from the pinch, <br>
            they are ready to be pressed in the pan. If they feel dry, sandy, and lose their shape <br>
            when released from the pinch, stir in more butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the crumb mixture to the pie plate. Using the flat bottom of a measuring cup or <br>
            glass, firmly press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and up the sides of the pan, <br>
            mounding the edge slightly above the rim of the pie plate. (Your hands or a flat spatula <br>
            may be helpful to press the sides of the crust.) Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until <br>
            dry and golden brown.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk, key lime juice, egg yolks, and <br>
            zest. Whisk to combine. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the filling into the warm crust and give it a jiggle to level things out. Bake <br>
            at 350°F for about 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 20 minutes, then chill <br>
            for at least an hour. You’ll see some tiny holes in the pie and it will jiggle <br>
            slightly when it’s done baking. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer along with the beaters or <br>
            whisk attachment in the fridge or freezer until well chilled, at least 20 minutes. <br>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Topping</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large, chilled bowl, combine the cream, sugar, and vanilla. With a handheld <br>
            mixer (or in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment), beat on medium speed until <br>
            frothy and starting to thicken, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-high <br>
            and beat until soft to medium peaks form, 1 to 2 more minutes. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Top the pie with dollops of whipped cream, lime zest, and slices if you like, and serve.<br>
        </li>
    </ol>
